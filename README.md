## About Me
Welcome to my writing portfolio! My name is Erin Pimentel and I am...

## Portfolio Overview
This repository acts as a technical writing portfolio that showcases my written scientific &amp; technical work. Currently, this repository hosts 2 conference abstracts showcasing my scientific research on Venus and the Moon, 1 procedural document that samples part of the workflow I developed processing legacy LiDAR data, 1 methods document that samples part of the methods section of a fellowship application, and 3 code samples showcasing some codes that I developed for automating geoprocessing tasks with arcpy in ArcGIS Pro. All of the samples in this repository were produced during the course of my graduate career for projects that I was personally working on, and some of these samples are published online (as part of published conference abstracts, for example). Anything published has gone through the edits and revisions of my research supervisors but, as the works I show here were intentionally chosen because they come from individual student research projects, all writing (and figures) showcased remain 100% my own. For samples of my work taken from unpublished research, these samples may be modified to exclude anything considered high-priority to the science, but please feel free to ask me about them if you have questions.
