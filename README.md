### About My Writing Portfolio
This repository acts as a writing portfolio that showcases my written scientific &amp; technical work. Unless otherwise indicated, all of the samples in this repository were produced during the course of my academic research career for projects that I was personally working on, and some of these samples are published online (as part of published conference abstracts, for example). Anything published has gone through the edits and revisions of my research supervisors but, as the works I show here were intentionally chosen because they come from individual student research projects, all writing showcased remains 100% my own. For samples of my work taken from unpublished research, these samples may be modified to exclude anything considered high-priority to the science.
