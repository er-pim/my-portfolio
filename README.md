## About Me
Welcome to my portfolio! In this repository, I have compiled a variety of samples showcasing my technical & scientific writing and coding skills.

## Portfolio Overview
<div align="justify"> This repository acts as a technical writing portfolio that showcases my written scientific and technical work. All of the samples in this repository were produced during the course of my graduate career for projects that I was personally working on, and some of these samples are published online (as part of published conference abstracts, for example). Anything published has gone through the edits and revisions of my research supervisors but, as the works I show here were intentionally chosen because they come from individual student research projects, all writing (and figures) showcased remain 100% my own. For samples of my work taken from unpublished research, these samples may be modified to exclude anything considered high-priority to the science, but please feel free to ask me about them if you have questions. </div>

<div align="justify"> Currently, this repository hosts:
  <br><h4> Conference Abstract - Venus Radar Altimetry </h4>
  1 conference abstract showcasing my scientific research on Venus
  <br><h4> Sample - LiDAR Software Procedure  </h4>
  1 procedural document that samples part of the workflow I developed processing legacy LiDAR data, 
  <br><h4> Lunar Dataset Description & GIS Integration </h4>
  1 document that samples part of the methods section for my scientific research on the Moon, 
  <br><h4> Code Sample - Automated Map Creation with ArcPy </h4>
  1 code sample showcasing some code that I developed for automating geoprocessing tasks with arcpy in ArcGIS Pro, and 
  <br><h4> Code Sample - Simple Hapke Reflectance Model </h4>
  another code sample I wrote to model bidirectional and hemispherical reflectance using Hapke theory (another component of my Moon research).
