## About
Welcome! In this repository, I have compiled a variety of samples that highlight my technical/scientific writing and coding skills.

## Portfolio Overview
<div align="justify"> This repository acts as a portfolio that showcases my written scientific and technical work. All of the samples in this repository were produced during the course of my graduate career for projects that I individually worked on, and some of these samples are published online (as part of published conference abstracts, for example). Anything published has gone through the edits and revisions of my research supervisors; however, as the works I show here were intentionally chosen because they come from individual student research projects, all writing (and figures) showcased remain 100% my own. For samples of my work taken from unpublished research, these samples may be modified to exclude anything considered high-priority to the science, but please feel free to ask me about them if you have questions. </div>

<div align="justify"> Currently, this repository hosts:
  <br><h4> Conference Abstract - Venus Radar Altimetry </h4>
  1 conference abstract showcasing my scientific research on Venus
  <br><h4> Writing Sample - LiDAR Software Procedure  </h4>
  1 procedural document that samples part of the workflow I developed processing legacy LiDAR data, 
  <br><h4> Writing Sample - Lunar Dataset Description & GIS Integration </h4>
  1 document that samples part of the methods section for my scientific research on the Moon, 
  <br><h4> Code Sample - Simple Hapke Reflectance Model </h4>
  1 code sample I wrote to model bidirectional and hemispherical reflectance using Hapke theory (another component of my Moon research).
